# SOLID Principles

`SOLID` Principles is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable[1]. The members of `SOLID` principles are:

- **Single-responsibility principle**: <br>
    "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor." It is important to keep a class focused on a single concern to make the class more robust [2]. <br>
    Code: [01_single_responsibility.cpp](https://github.com/terrence-ou/Design-Patterns-CPP/blob/main/SOLID/01_single_responsibility.cpp)
    <br>
- **Open-closed principle**: <br>
    "Software entities (class, modules, function, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." That is, such an entity can allow its behavior to be extended without modifying its source code [3].<br>
    Code: [02_open_close.cpp](https://github.com/terrence-ou/Design-Patterns-CPP/blob/main/SOLID/02_open_close.cpp)

- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle
