# Design Patterns in C++


Design patterns represent solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. By understanding these patterns, developers can write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of implementation examples for classical design patterns, using C++ with C++17 standard.

Some contents of this repository references the book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?crid=G5JCPY0NGIQ&keywords=design+patterns&qid=1694536813&sprefix=design+patt%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-1)) and the cource *Design Patterns in Modern C++* ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/)).
